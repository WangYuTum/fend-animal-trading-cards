			<p>The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States of America. The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish, which it swoops down and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest nest of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to 4m deep, 2.5m wide, and 1 metric ton in weight.</p>
